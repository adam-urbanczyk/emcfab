helicoil id 0.080 - 0.090, 
average coil diamter 0.010, 
thread pitch 30 - 50

minor diameters:

	#6-32 :0.098
	#4-40 :0.081
	#5-40 :0.094

#6-32 helicoil is probably closest

pressure = 2000psi at the surface of the helicoil

material of metal, but lowest friction coefficient possible is good:
	steel->al = .45
	steel->cu = .22
	steel->bronze = 0.35
	steel->steel 0.8

	teflon 0.04
