5/16/2010 Notes:

things to fix when you need to do the next set:

1.  merge outrigger and base into 1 program with pause
2.  there is no need to remove the original holding screws, as long as the tool tip is long enough
3.  move existing screws to allow cutting both profiles without impacting tools, and to minimize waste between the pieces
4.  make sure to use the right tool to cut the plastic. dont use the 1/8 mill!
5.  add a finishing pass around the outer profiles at the full depth to get a good clean finish
6.  add finishing pass around profiles on al pieces to get a clean finish also
