OCC Learnings

Performance
	BRep_Tool.Range( ) is much faster than using Wrappers.Edge
	beware creating objects-- garbage collection times are significant.

Weird things
	strange things happen when you try to use native python lists for occ objects
	when you build edges into a wire, the hash code of the edges changes.
